# Developing an interactive HTML5 form validation with RegEx and JS

This app is developed as part of my 6 months coding bootcamp at Integrify Helsinki. It was developed using RegEx as a validation mechanism and JS as programming language. Users can get real time validation information about the current field before going to the next one. The submit field is only enabled after the entire input fields are correctly filled as per the programmed RegEx patterns. All functionalities was completed with ONLY Vanilla JavaScript. Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.
